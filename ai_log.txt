2024-10-09: CommandService Enhanced Debugging
- Implemented advanced error handling for WPML parsing
- Added detailed logging for mission upload process
- Enhanced XML parsing resilience
- Improved mission configuration validation

2024-10-09: WPML Format Compliance Fixes
- Fixed coordinate order in KML (longitude,latitude format)
- Added proper ellipsoid height calculation for Islamabad area (580m ground elevation)
- Implemented dynamic distance and duration calculation
- Added KMZ file validation before upload
- Enhanced template XML with required coordinate system parameters
- Improved error handling for mission upload process
- Verified all required WPML elements are present

2024-10-13: WPML Format Issues Identified and FIXED
- CRITICAL ISSUE RESOLVED: generateTemplateXml() was using incorrect <wpml:template> wrapper tag
- FIXED: Template.kml now properly empty for waypoint-only missions: <Document></Document>
- FIXED: KMZ file structure - files now in root level (waylines.wpml, template.kml) not in wpmz/ subfolder
- FIXED: Added required droneInfo (M30: droneEnumValue=67, droneSubEnumValue=0) in waylines.wpml
- FIXED: Added required payloadInfo (M30 Camera: payloadEnumValue=52, payloadPositionIndex=0) in waylines.wpml
- FIXED: Namespace version corrected to 1.0.2 (was 1.0.6)
- FIXED: Added takeOffSecurityHeight parameter for proper mission config
- ALL WPML FORMAT ISSUES RESOLVED - CommandService_Fixed.java created with proper DJI specification compliance

2024-10-13: Template.kml Empty - Confirmed by DJI Documentation
- CONFIRMED: Empty template.kml is CORRECT for Mobile SDK V5 applications
- Mobile SDK only executes waylines.wpml file - firmware ignores template.kml completely
- Template.kml is only used by DJI Pilot 2 for route planning/generation
- Empty template.kml will NOT affect mission execution - aircraft follows waylines.wpml only
- KMZ structure compliance maintained for compatibility with both DJI Pilot 2 and Mobile SDK

2025-10-14: COMPLETE REWRITE - DJI SDK WPMZManager Integration
- CRITICAL: Replaced manual XML generation with official DJI SDK WPMZManager.generateKMZFile()
- Created CommandService_V5SDK.java using proper DJI SDK patterns from uploaded utility files
- Integrated KMZTestUtil.java for creating WaylineMission, WaylineMissionConfig, and Template objects
- Created supporting classes:
  * KMZTestUtil.java - Creates mission component factory
  * MissionGlobalModel.java - Stores mission configuration (finish action, RC lost behavior)
  * WaypointInfoModel.java - Combines waypoint location with action information
- WPMZManager.generateKMZFile() automatically creates PROPER waylines.wpml and template.kml files
- Follows exact DJI SDK sample structure from uploaded files (KMZTestUtil, WaylinesParseInfo, etc.)
- Uses DJI SDK Template class to properly structure waypoint information
- Properly creates WaylineWaypoint objects with location, yaw params, and action groups
- ActionInfos properly structured using KMZTestUtil.createActionInfo() for gimbal and photo actions
- Files created:
  * /Services/CommandService_V5SDK.java (new service using WPMZManager)
  * /utils/KMZTestUtil.java (mission component factory)
  * /models/MissionGlobalModel.java (mission settings)
  * /utils/wpml/WaypointInfoModel.java (waypoint data model)
- OLD CommandService.java kept as backup but should NOT be used
- NEW CommandService_V5SDK.java is the CORRECT implementation using official DJI SDK methods
- This approach eliminates ALL manual XML generation errors - DJI SDK handles WPML format internally

2025-10-14: WaypointActivity Analysis - Integration with CommandService_V5SDK
ANALYZED: WaypointActivity.java is currently bound to OLD CommandService.java
REQUIRED CHANGES to use NEW CommandService_V5SDK.java:
1. Import statement: Change from "CommandService" to "CommandService_V5SDK"
2. Service reference variable: Change type from "CommandService" to "CommandService_V5SDK"
3. Service binding Intent: Change from "CommandService.class" to "CommandService_V5SDK.class"
4. Service binder cast: Change from "CommandService.CommandServiceBinder" to "CommandService_V5SDK.CommandServiceBinder"
5. Broadcast receiver IntentFilter: Change from "CommandService.ACTION_WAYPOINT_STATUS" to "CommandService_V5SDK.ACTION_WAYPOINT_STATUS"
6. All broadcast extra constants: Prefix with "CommandService_V5SDK" instead of "CommandService"
7. All status type constants: Prefix with "CommandService_V5SDK" instead of "CommandService"

COMPATIBILITY: CommandService_V5SDK has IDENTICAL public API to CommandService:
- startWaypointMission() - Creates and uploads mission using DJI SDK
- stopMission() - Stops mission execution
- pauseMission() - Pauses mission execution
- resumeMission() - Resumes paused mission
- All broadcast actions and extras are SAME
- Binder class structure is SAME

NO OTHER CHANGES NEEDED:
- UI layout remains same
- Button listeners remain same
- Map functionality remains same
- Broadcast receiver logic remains same
- Only service class reference needs update

2025-10-14: CRITICAL BUG - Waylines.wpml Parser Error Code 5
ISSUE DIAGNOSED: WaylineWaylinesParseInfo returns error code 5 - waylines array EMPTY
ROOT CAUSE FOUND: KMZTestUtil.createMissionConfig() creates EMPTY WaylineDroneInfo and WaylinePayloadInfo
- Line 81-86 of KMZTestUtil.java creates blank objects without drone type or payload info
- Generated waylines.wpml has droneEnumValue=65535 (UNKNOWN) - REJECTED by DJI parser
- Missing payloadInfo section causes parser validation failure
EVIDENCE: Extracted waylines.wpml shows:
  <wpml:droneEnumValue>65535</wpml:droneEnumValue> ❌ INVALID
  <wpml:payloadInfo>[]</wpml:payloadInfo> ❌ EMPTY
REQUIRED FIX in KMZTestUtil.createMissionConfig():
1. Set proper drone type: droneInfo.setDroneType(WaylineDroneType.M30) for M30/M30T
2. Set drone sub type: droneInfo.setDroneSubType(0)
3. Create proper payloadInfo with payloadType and position index
4. Add payloadInfo to config.setPayloadInfo() list
DRONE TYPE VALUES (from DJI SDK):
- M30/M30T: WaylineDroneType.M30 (enumValue=67)
- M300 RTK: WaylineDroneType.MATRICE_300_RTK (enumValue=60)
- Mavic 3: WaylineDroneType.MAVIC_3_ENTERPRISE_SERIES (enumValue=77)
PAYLOAD TYPE VALUES:
- M30/M30T Camera: WaylinePayloadType.DJI_CAMERA (enumValue=52, positionIndex=0)
FIX IMPLEMENTED in KMZTestUtil.createMissionConfig()

2025-10-16: MainActivity Connection Analysis - Requested by User
REQUEST: User wants to understand how real-time drone connection works in MainActivity.java
ANALYZED MainActivity.java connection mechanism:

CONNECTION FLOW:
1. MainActivity extends DJIMainActivity (base activity with SDK management)
2. observeSDKStates() sets up LiveData observers:
   - getLvProductConnectionState() - Gets connection status (connected boolean + productId)
   - getLvProductChanges() - Notifies when product changes
3. observeProductTypeChanges() monitors MSDKInfoVm.getCurrentProductType() LiveData
4. When connection state changes → isDroneConnected flag updates → updateConnectionLogic() called
5. When ProductType changes → currentProductType updates → updateConnectionLogic() called
6. updateConnectionLogic() checks BOTH isDroneConnected AND currentProductType != UNKNOWN
   - If both true → UI shows connected (green images, "Connected" text)
   - If either false → UI shows disconnected (red images, "Disconnected" text)

KEY COMPONENTS:
- MSDKManagerVM (from DJIMainActivity): Provides connection state LiveData
- MSDKInfoVm: Provides ProductType LiveData via KeyManager.listen() on ProductKey.KeyProductType
- isDroneConnected: Boolean flag storing connection state
- currentProductType: ProductType enum storing drone model
- updateConnectionLogic(): Central method that updates UI based on connection + product type

REAL-TIME MECHANISM:
- Uses LiveData observers that automatically trigger on value changes
- MSDKInfoVm uses KeyManager.listen() for real-time ProductType updates from SDK
- Fallback polling every 5 seconds in case listener fails (Timer in MSDKInfoVm)
- forceProductTypeRefresh() method available for manual refresh

USER REQUEST: Two solutions for using connection state across multiple activities
SOLUTION 1: Singleton pattern to access connection state from MainActivity
SOLUTION 2: ConnectionService as a bound service for system-wide connection monitoring

NO CODE CHANGES MADE - Analysis only as per user request

2025-10-16: CameraFeedFragment Orientation Change Issue - Analysis
USER ISSUE: Camera feed stops when device orientation changes (portrait ↔ landscape)

ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:
1. Android recreates Activity/Fragment on orientation change by default
2. FPVCameraActivity has android:configChanges="screenSize|keyboardHidden" in manifest
   - This PREVENTS activity recreation BUT missing "orientation" flag
   - Fragment still gets destroyed and recreated
3. Fragment lifecycle during orientation change:
   - onPause() → stopCameraStream() called
   - onSurfaceTextureDestroyed() → stopCameraStream() called again
   - Fragment destroyed
   - NEW fragment created
   - onCreateView() → onViewCreated() → initUI()
   - onSurfaceTextureAvailable() → startCameraStream() called
4. PROBLEM: Surface object becomes invalid after orientation change
   - Old Surface reference still held by cameraStreamManager
   - New Surface created but not properly registered
5. TextureView.getSurfaceTexture() returns NEW instance after recreation
   - Old surface not removed from cameraStreamManager
   - putCameraStreamSurface() called with new surface but old one still exists

CRITICAL ISSUES IN CODE:
1. stopCameraStream() creates NEW Surface object instead of using existing reference
   - Line: "Surface surface = new Surface(cameraTextureView.getSurfaceTexture())"
   - This creates DIFFERENT surface than what was registered
   - removeCameraStreamSurface() fails to remove the correct surface
2. No surface reference stored - can't properly clean up
3. onSurfaceTextureDestroyed() returns true, destroying texture immediately
4. Fragment recreation loses all state (isDroneConnected, isStreamStarted)
5. ConnectionStateManager observers registered in onViewCreated get re-registered

SOLUTIONS PROVIDED TO USER (NO CODE CHANGES MADE):

SOLUTION 1: Add "orientation" to configChanges (Recommended)
- Add android:configChanges="orientation|screenSize|keyboardHidden" to FPVCameraActivity
- Prevents fragment recreation on orientation change
- Activity/Fragment handle orientation change without destruction
- Stream continues without interruption

SOLUTION 2: Proper Surface Lifecycle Management
- Store Surface reference as class field
- Use stored reference in stopCameraStream() instead of creating new one
- Remove surface in onSurfaceTextureDestroyed() before returning true
- Add onConfigurationChanged() override to handle orientation without recreation

SOLUTION 3: Fragment Retained Instance
- Use setRetainInstance(true) in fragment (deprecated but works)
- Fragment survives orientation change
- State variables preserved (isDroneConnected, isStreamStarted)

SOLUTION 4: ViewModel for State Management
- Move connection state and stream state to ViewModel
- Survives configuration changes
- Proper Android architecture pattern

BEST SOLUTION: Combine Solution 1 + Solution 2
- Add "orientation" to configChanges
- Store Surface reference properly
- Clean up surface correctly

ANALYSIS COMPLETE - Waiting for user decision on which solution to implement

2025-10-20: ProjectDialogFragment Orientation-Based Layout Update
USER REQUEST: Modify ProjectDialogFragment to support two different display modes:
1. PORTRAIT MODE: Full screen dialog (width: MATCH_PARENT, height: MATCH_PARENT)
2. LANDSCAPE MODE: Right sidebar (width: 540dp, height: MATCH_PARENT, gravity: END, slide animation from right)

IMPLEMENTATION:
1. Added imports for Dialog, Window, WindowManager, and Gravity classes
2. Overridden onCreateDialog() to remove window title in portrait mode for true full screen
3. Modified resizeDialog() method to handle orientation-based layout:
   - PORTRAIT: Sets width and height to MATCH_PARENT, center gravity
   - LANDSCAPE: Sets width to 540dp, height to MATCH_PARENT, END gravity (right align), applies slide animation
4. Applied DialogAnimationFromRight style for landscape mode (slide in from right, slide out to right)
5. Added detailed logging for debugging dialog configuration

FILES CREATED:
- /res/anim/slide_in_right.xml - Slide in animation (100% to 0% on X axis, 300ms duration)
- /res/anim/slide_out_right.xml - Slide out animation (0% to 100% on X axis, 300ms duration)

FILES MODIFIED:
- /Fragments/ProjectDialogFragment.java - Updated resizeDialog() and onCreateDialog() methods

ANIMATION STYLE:
- DialogAnimationFromRight style already exists in /res/values/styles.xml
- References slide_in_right and slide_out_right animations
- Applied only in landscape mode for smooth right sidebar appearance

BEHAVIOR:
- Portrait: Dialog appears as full screen overlay (like a new activity)
- Landscape: Dialog slides in from right as 540dp sidebar
- Maintains all existing functionality (project loading, search, selection callbacks)
- Compatible with all existing usage patterns (upload photos mode, MediaManager, mission planner)
